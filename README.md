# Prime Collapse: Emergent Primality from Recursive Arithmetic Strain

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper *Prime Collapse*, a novel strain-theoretic model of prime number emergence. The model predicts prime locations as collapse points of recursive arithmetic tensionâ€”without using the zeta function, sieve methods, or explicit primality inputs.
